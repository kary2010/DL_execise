Thus it's still valid to use ablkcipher algorithms.

Fix the case when implementers register ablkcipher algorithms
and cryptodev casts them to skcipher without checking their type.

Note: alg returned by crypto_ablkcipher_alg() is no longer checked
to be non-NULL. This is guaranteed by the fact that ablkcipher_tfm
(out->async.s) is valid.Thus it's still valid to use ablkcipher algorithms.
